				<p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). He is best known in popular culture for his mass-energy equivalence formula E=mcÂ² (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"), as well as his iconic formula for the photoelectric effect.</p>
				<p>Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".</p>
				<p>Einstein's contributions to science and philosophy have had a profound impact on the world, and he remains one of the most recognizable and iconic figures in history.</p>
